# Spatial Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Coyote Distribution in British Columbia     
•	Spatial Statistical Analysis of Coyote
This project aimed to explore the spatial distribution of coyotes in British Columbia and identify key environmental factors influencing their distribution. For this project, I collected geographic distribution data on coyotes in BC and conducted exploratory data analysis using tools such as heatmaps and pair correlation functions (PCF) to gain initial insights into distribution patterns and clustering. Next, to investigate the primary factors affecting coyote distribution, I applied spatial modeling and developed a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) based on environmental variables. The analysis revealed that the most influential factors were water distance and the Human Footprint Index. Additionally, the model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting coyote distribution patterns.

# Life-expectacy-Research

•	Life expectancy – Regression Analysis


This project aimed to explore the difference of best predictors for life expectancy in developed and developing countries. In this project, we collected nearly 200 countries' life expectancy data and trained them with linear regression. In order to optimize the linear regression model and verify the interchangeability of the linear model for developed, developing countries and worldwide, we utilized the best regression subsets and model accuracy metrics, such as Cp, AIC, and adjusted R^2. We have found that the best predictor for developing and developed countries is very different. Thinness is the best predictor for developed countries, and Schooling, HIV and AIDS are the most influential factors for developing countries. We also found that the linear model for developing countries is near to the worldwide linear model.

# Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

•	Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

This project aimed to explore data scientists' salaries increasing/decreasing trend, salaries distribution and the most influential factors for data scientists' salary levels. In this project, I collected data scientists' salaries dataset from 2020 to 2022, and made exploratory data analysis for it, including but not limited to analyzing and virtualizing salary increasing trends and salaries' distribution depending on working years, working experience, working region and working competence. And depending on global scientists' salary distribution, I divided data scientists' wages into three levels, and used classification models including logistical regression, random forest and neural network to explore the relationship between data scientists' salary level and the possible covariates. I have found out that the best model for salary level classification is random forest, and the most effective factors are job title, employee residence and company location.

#	Vancouver Tour Advice

•	Vancouver Tour Advice

This project aimed to investigate Vancouver's best daily trip schedule for fresh UBC students. We collected data of Great Vancouver's tour attractions, selected the 12 most visited attractions and tried to design a "best" tour plan with the most attractions visited by combinatorial optimization tools. In order to shorten the visiting time most, we transformed the one-day tour question as a Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP), and utilized heuristic method and programming tools to solve the integer regression problem for attractions selection. And to reduce the time cost while planning and make our trip schedule more flexible, we optimized the Vancouver attractions selection by transforming it as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, and solved it by dynamic programming.

# Simulation of the background ticket system

•	Simulation of the background ticket system

This project aimed to simulate the ticket system's background by Java. You can enter the simulated system as an administrator, reset identification information, and work as a ticketing staff: store new tickets' information from the back-end panel, including ticket's starting point, destination, ticket type, and check any ticket's information.
